# OuroWebTools :toolbox:

I created this application to try automating some processes while working at [OuroWeb (Custom Software)](https://customsoftware.com.br/). It's an application designed to be primarily used through its system tray icon.

This was the first project I worked on that started to follow standards more aligned with popular programming practices in the market that I tried to learn on my own, such as "Clean Code" and "Clean Architecture".

The application was built with C# and WPF using the .NET Framework in conjunction with the MVVM methodology.

In addition to being a study object for WPF, component reuse, classes and methods, automation processes, and centralized problem-solving in a single application with the goal of easy maintenance and usability.
